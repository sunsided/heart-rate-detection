## Interbeat Interval (IBI) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

> The interbeat interval, also known as the heart rate or pulse, refers to the time between successive heartbeats.
> It is typically measured in beats per minute (bpm). The heart rate can vary depending on factors such as age,
> physical activity, emotional state, and overall health. Here are some typical interbeat intervals for
> different age groups:

> Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the variation in time between successive heartbeats. It is an essential measure
> of the autonomic nervous system's activity and overall cardiac health. HRV is typically assessed by analyzing
> the time intervals between R-peaks (R-R intervals) in an electrocardiogram (ECG) or heart rate data.
> HRV can be quantified in various ways, and different metrics may be used to assess it. One common metric is the
> standard deviation of normal R-R intervals (SDNN).
